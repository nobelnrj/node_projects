        <h1 id="h1">The yearly survey</h1>
        <p>
          This survey about the market value of smartphones starts from 2010 to
          2019. The survey has some content which really astonishes. The whole
          of the year 2010 was dominated by <strong>Nokia</strong>.
          <strong>Nokia</strong> had 33.17% of the market whereas
          <strong>Apple</strong> had 30.19%. This may not seem to be a big
          difference but it's just the beginning. By the end of 2010 the top
          five companies were
          <strong
            >Nokia, Apple, RIM(Blackberry), Samsung and SonyEricsson</strong
          >. The next year (2011) was also dominated by
          <strong>Nokia</strong> which had 39.72% of the market whereas
          <strong>Apple</strong> had 26.15%. Now i hope you understand what I
          meant earlier. By the end of 2011 the top five companies were
          <strong
            >Nokia, Apple, Samsung, RIM(Blackberry) and SonyEricsson</strong
          >. <strong>Apple</strong> started dominating <strong>Nokia</strong> by
          the end of 2012. It was this when <strong>HTC</strong> registered its
          name in world histroy by eliminating
          <strong>RIM(Blackberry)</strong> out of top five companies.
          <strong>Apple</strong> finally achieved it's goal which didn't last
          much. By the end of 2013 <strong>Samsung</strong> dominated 27.7% of
          the market value with <strong>Apple</strong> having just 21.3%. Then
          started the real race between <strong>Samsung</strong> and
          <strong>Apple</strong>. But by the end of 2014
          <strong>Samsung</strong> reached the level of Nokia by holding 33.34%
          of the market. At the same time LG became the forth in the market
          value. The year 2015 was not the year for
          <strong>Apple</strong> because the market value kept decreasing. By
          the end <strong>Samsung</strong> had 30.84% whereas
          <strong>Apple</strong> had 19.5%. The same continued the whole of
          2016. This is when <strong>Huawei</strong> became forth which resulted
          in <strong>Nokia</strong> being fifth in market value. The year 2017
          was also the same but with the sad part in smartphone history.
          <strong>Nokia</strong> was completely removed from top eight positions
          by new companies like <strong>Xiaomi ,OPPO and Motorola</strong>. Even
          though <strong>Apple</strong> was not able to defeated
          <strong>Samsung</strong> in market the release of
          <strong>"iPhone X"</strong> was a significant one. Till 2019
          <strong>Samsung</strong> remains the top most company in world market
          with an potential opponent (Huawei) in third position.

        <p>
          Though most of the companies does not look good when a survey of their
          market value is taken into account. But all the smartphone companies
          that exist have specialized themselves in certain fields. For example
          <strong>Apple</strong> is the first company to integrote finger print
          scanner in smartphones. <strong>Samsung</strong> is the first company
          to implement curved screen to provide best viewing angles for the
          user. <strong>Nokia</strong> as we all know is known for it's build
          quality. <strong>RIM(Blackberry)</strong> is the most secured phone
          which many people prefer to buy. <strong>Huawei</strong> and
          <strong>OPPO</strong> are known for their camera. They developed their
          camera ability in such a way that it replaced DSLR.
          <strong>Oneplus</strong> which till now didn't achieve big things it
          smartphone market is the first smartphone company to provide Amoled
          display on mid-range smartphones. <strong>Xiaomi</strong> provided the
          cheaper phones with high performance. Then came new inventions like
          notch and pop-up cameras which was adopted by all companies. So from
          the above content it should be clear for you that no company stayed in
          the market without creating something new. People always want
          something new for their eyes. First smartphones were with
          <strong>big bezels and small screen</strong>. Then phones with
          <strong>notch</strong> to replace those bezel and make the view port
          bigger. Even then the developers were not satisfied. They wanted the
          users to experience more which lead to removing the notch and bringing
          in <strong>dotted notch or pop-up cameras</strong> to enable full
          screen display for the users.
